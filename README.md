Other Info:  
  This project was done for **CS246** at **BYU-I**.
  To be able to create this program in the time allocated we will start with the original code for Bludbourne.
  Some of the planned changes include new menus, a new party system, and battle UI.

More Info:  
  This project was created using the libgdx library. Found [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).  
  Mastering LibGDX Game Development by Patrick Hoey was a big help in this. Find his book [here](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-libgdx-game-development).  
  This project started with code from Bludbourne and several classes were changed, created and modified.
  The BludBourne code, in all of it's originality can be found on Patrick Hoey's GitHub [here](https://github.com/patrickhoey/BludBourne)
  Bludbourne is open source as indicated on page **418** of Mastering LibGDX GameDevelopment.
